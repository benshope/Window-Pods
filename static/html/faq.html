                <p>Window Pods suction cups are specifically designed for long-term installation.  Their shape requires thoughtful application compared to conventional suction cups, but, once correctly applied to a window - they form an enduring seal.  Here are a few helpful tips:</p>
                <p>If the suction cup needs to be cleaned, wash in warm soapy water then dry gently with a lint-free cloth.</p>
                <p>Clean the surface you are applying the suction cup to.</p>
                <p>To enhance suction, a tiny dab of Vaseline or cooking oil may be rubbed on the rim of the cup.</p>
                <p>The suction cup may need to be “burped” periodically by pressing the center to remove any air that may have seeped in.</p>
