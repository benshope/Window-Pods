                <p>Window Pods suction cups are specifically designed for long-term installation.  Their shape requires thoughtful application compared to conventional suction cups, but, once correctly applied to a window - they form an enduring seal.  Here are a few helpful tips:</p>
                <p>If the suction cup needs to be cleaned, wash in warm soapy water then dry gently with a lint-free cloth.</p>
                <p>Clean the surface you are applying the suction cup to.</p>
                <p>To enhance suction, a tiny dab of Vaseline or cooking oil may be rubbed on the rim of the cup.</p>
                <p>The suction cup may need to be “burped” periodically by pressing the center to remove any air that may have seeped in.</p>

                    <accordion-group heading="What is the right technique for watering plants? ">
                      Not on the window! (or if you do, put a towel down) I grab my Pods off the window, soak them in the sink, and leave them to drain in the drying rack for a few minutes. This ensures that the soil is fully watered, but not soggy, just like natural rainfall.

                    <accordion-group heading="What kind of plants work best?">
                        Any kind of plant that can grow in a small flowerpot should work.  That said, we like to grow plants that are drought-resistant (like succulents and cacti) and plants that are fast-sprouting (like wheatgrass and sprouts). This is because we sometimes forget to water our plants for weeks at a time. For any other forgetful gardeners out there (you know who you are), here is a list of easy plants:
                        <ul>
                            <li>ADD LIST XXXXXXXX</li>
                        </ul>
                    </accordion-group>

                    <accordion-group heading="Will the Window Pods suction cup work in extreme climates?">
                        With the correct surface prep, The Pods will stick to the window in any condition they encounter. In extreme climates, applying a tiny amount of cooking oil or Vaseline will create an evaporation-proof seal.
                    </accordion-group>

                    <accordion-group heading="How long will Window Pods remain attached to my window?">
                        <p>From personal experience - all of the pods on my window have remained up for many months with no need to "burp" the air bubble that forms in the suction cup.</p>

                        <p>The time a suction cup adheres to a window is affected by many factors - including cleanliness of the window, weight, and vibration. The Window Pods suction cup works around this issue by visibly developing an air bubble over time, which indicates that the suction cup's vacuum is weakening. A quick press, to diminish that air bubble, will completely replenish the suction cup's gripping power.</p>
                    </accordion-group>

                    <accordion-group heading="How do I hang Window Pods on the wall?">
                        Window Pods look great installed on the window, or on the wall!  You can hang plants just like a picture.  Just tap a small nail or large pin into the wall and hang them up.
